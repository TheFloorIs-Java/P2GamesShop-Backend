# P2GamesShop-Backend
This is the Backend API for a simulated online games shop. It leverages Spring boot to consolidate the code and connect
with an Azure database to interact with our data. We used ORM to control the tables using this code rather than
using SQL in a DB manager. There is also AOP in the form of logging that notes whenever any method is called.
